# Road-Semantic-Segmentation-Between-CNNs-and-Vision-Transformers-
This project compares CNN-based models (ConvNeXt, C-UNet) and the transformer-based SegFormer for semantic road segmentation on satellite imagery. Using the EPFL dataset, we show that SegFormer outperforms CNNs by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information efficiently.
